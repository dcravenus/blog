Eighth Grade drew me in emotionally and invited me to really connect with its eighth-grade protagonist, Kayla, and her patient, supportive father. Adolescent emotion is shown vibrantly, and while Kayla's ups and downs are portrayed with humor, they are not mocked or belittled.

The portrayal of Kayla's crush is a good example of the way the film treats emotion. Upbeat music booms through the theater as the boy voted to have "best eyes" moves aloofly by in slow motion. My adult self laughed at how much grandeur is afforded to an average middle-school kid, but I was also invited to take an eighth-grade girl's crush more seriously and to give her emotions and experiences the respect they deserve. Kayla experiences extreme emotional highs and lows and she tries to muddle her way through the awkwardness of adolescene.  Many times during the film I cringed and suffered watching Kayla be thrust into painful and mature situations. Other scenes brought welcome relief and satisfaction as Kayla learns to love and respect herself.

The film helped me learn to let go and trust that middle-schoolers are smarter and deeper than they are given credit for, and are capable of doing great things on their own. I highly recommend it based on its honest and heartfelt exploration of one eighth-grade girl.
