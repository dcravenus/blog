I've been getting into reading manga lately. I think graphic novels in general get ghettoized and treated like they aren't as literary as other books. Consequently I want to read them to make sure no genre is getting marginalized.

My most recently-read manga is Junji Ito's _Gyo_. I became aware of Junji Ito from a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIIA6QDgl2M) that talked about how well Ito does horror and how well he utilizes the graphic novel media to accomplish his goals. After reading _Gyo_ I have to agree that Ito uses his genre masterfully.

The story is pretty ominous from the beginning and the imagery gets more and more horrific as the manga progresses. I was surprised how creepy a fish with legs could be, and how far Ito was able to take the concept. The story continuously builds, growing increasingly more extreme. Just when you think things can't get any worse, they do.

There are a couple extra short stories at the end that are also pretty chilling. I especially enjoyed "The Enigma of Amigara Fault." The story has a fatalistic inevitability to it where the characters recognize the danger facing them but submit anyway. I've been thinking a lot about being at peace with one's circumstances and accepting whatever life brings, and this story brought another facet to the idea of submitting to whatever comes.

All the stories included in _Gyo_ were a lot of fun to read. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in horror manga, as long as they are comfortable with some pretty graphic imagery. The images get pretty gory and are definitely targeted at mature audiences, so _Gyo_ is not for everyone. Nevertheless, reading the book was quite enjoyable and made me eager to see more of what Junji Ito has to offer.
